    <h1><b>Revelation</b></h1>
    <h2><b>by Robert Frost</b></h2>
    <p>We make ourselves a place apart</br>
        &nbsp Behind light words that tease and flout,</br>
        But oh, the agitated heart</br>
        &nbsp Till someone find us really out.
    </p>
    <p>â€™Tis pity if the case require </br>
        &nbsp (Or so we say) that in the end</br>
        We speak the literal to inspire</br>
        &nbsp The understanding of a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
        But so with all, from babes that play</br>
        &nbsp At hide-and-seek to God afar,</br>
        So all who hide too well away</br>
        &nbsp Must speak and tell us where they are.
    </p>
